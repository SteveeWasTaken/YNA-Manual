== Functions ==
Functions work just like `\{set}`, but for code only. Simple!
    ***Syntax:***
    `\{func:myfunction;\{choose:one;two;};}` will create a new object called \{myfunction}. Whenever you call it, the code `\{choose:one;two;}` will run.
**You can store plain text on them, but it's not recommended. For this, you should use `set` or `save`! (Check them at `+t manual set` or `+t manual save`.)**
    `\{func:myfunction;Hello!;}` will create a new object called \{myfunction}. Whenever you call it, it will display \"Hello!\".
