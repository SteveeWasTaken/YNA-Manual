== Looping ==
**This will repeat a certain command until a counter reaches the number given.**
    ***Syntax:***
    `\{loop:1,10,1;Hi! ;}` will repeat \"Hi!\" 10 times. Keep in mind to add the space after the word so that it's separated.
**So we add 1 to the first number until it reaches 10. We can change how much we're adding to the number.**
    `\{loop:1,10,2;Hi! ;}` will repeat \"Hi!\" only 5 times.
**This time, we add 2 every step. 1+2=3, 3+2=5, 5+2=7, and 7+2=9. But since the maximum is 10, the program stops at 9, since 9+2=11.**
**You can also run code!**
    `\{loop:1,10,1;\{user:display_name;};}` will run \{user:display_name;} 10 times. Simple, right?
