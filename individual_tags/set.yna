== Set & Working with Variables ==
**The \{set} function is a way for you to store TEXT inside of objects. It's really powerful! (Keep in mind: The Variables will reset once the Tag is finished executing. If you want to prevent this, read the Manual's entry on \{save}.)**
    ***Syntax:***
    `\{set:myvar;hello}` will create a new object called \{myvar}. To mention it, use it as you would use a *format* object. Just do \{myvar}.
**If you wish, you can store code in them, but it's not really recommended. For this, you should use `function`! (Go to `+t manual function` to learn more about it.)**
    `\{set:myvar;\{choose:Hi;Hello;};}` will create a new object called \{myvar}, and when executed, will run `\{choose:Hi;Hello;}`. 
**You can check more about the `choose` object with `+t manual choose`.**
