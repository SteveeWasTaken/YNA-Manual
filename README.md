# YNA Coding Manual
A YNA Coding Manual so you can learn how to create your own tags.

## Installation
This is currently not possible, as the Manual can't be installed for now. Until then, you can check the Manual individually on the individual_tags folder.

If done incorrectly, you will see that 42 says that such tag doesn't exist. In that case, make sure that you have the LATEST .csv file, as outdated ones might break.
If you're sure that the .csv file is updated, but it's still not working, contact me on Discord! `SteveeWasTaken#5134`
