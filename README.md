# YNA Coding Manual
A YNA Coding Manual so you can learn how to create your own tags.

## Installation
Do you want to install this Manual on your own Discord server? It's simple!
### Requirements
- 42-Bot (Add her to your Discord Server: http://42.rockett.space/join)
- A .csv file found in the Releases tab. (Make sure it's the latest update, else, you might find issues with Tags not importing properly.)
### Instructions
1. Once added, all you have to do is run the following command: `+tag import` and attach the CSV file to the same message.
2. Run the `+tag manual` command, and if the import was successful, you should now see a message about the Manual.

If done incorrectly, you will see that 42 says that such tag doesn't exist. In that case, make sure that you have the LATEST .csv file, as outdated ones might break.
If you're sure that the .csv file is updated, but it's still not working, contact me on Discord! `SteveeWasTaken#5134`
